# Odin-Recipes
The first HTML website for The Odin Project!

Introduction: 
This is the first website that we are making with The Odin Project lessons. 
The website is an HTML website that will display a few recipes via links to pages within the same directory.

Goals:
1. Be able to put together a simple website and folder structure that is able to be expanded upon, and worked on easily by others. 
2. Demonstrate knowledge of HTML webpage structure and syntax.
3. Track changes with Git as source control locally and on GitHub.
